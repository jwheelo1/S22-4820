## Install PostgreSQL 

### Linux

I am using Ubuntu 20.04 for this.  

![ubuntu-download.page.png](ubuntu-download.page.png)

We are starting out with Linux because most
installs of PostgreSQL are on Linux.   Because of the "working model" memory 
management in Windows a relational database server runs better on a non-Windows
system.  Usually this is Linux.   FreeBSD/OpenBSD also work (but use a different
install process).  MacOS (Os X) is also good - but is rarely seen as a production
database environment.

You can run PostgreSQL in a Docker Container - but I don't recommend it in a production
context.  Docker is only suitable for use with a database in a development environment.
(That means that you can use Docker for this class and it will work - but don't
plan on deploying a production database on top of docker - the performance is
horrible)

If you are using a different version of Linux then the install process will be different.

We are going to use PostgreSQL as our primary database in the class.  You will need a copy
of it running where you can access the entire database.  This could be on a virtual machine
on your box or on Digital Ocean ($5.00 a month) or Linode ($5 to $20 a month) or on a
free micro system on AWS if you qualify for one or on a $15-20 AWS EC3 small system.

If you choose a virtual or remote system my recommendation would be to install Ubuntu on 
it.

### Step 0

Setup and install Virtual Box, then Install Ubuntu on it.

### Step 1

After you have gotten your Linux system up and running you should refresh
the local package index.


```
$ sudo apt update
```

Now install the PostgreSQL software:

```
$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

`sudo` will prompt you for your login password.  You will need to have an account that is
configured to be able to do sudo.  You should not do this from the root account.
Generally spiking I set up a system, generate public/private keys for SSH login,
create a user account, set it to be capable of sudo, verify that I can login
from my local account to the user account using the public/private keys,
then turn off login on the root account.  Double check that I can login without
getting a password prompt from my local system.  Then I start installs like this.


### Step 2 - Configure basic "roles"


Security in most databases, PostgreSQL, Oralce, MySQL are all based on 'roles' - these are groups of users that have similar
properties for how they access the database.  This is similar to Unix/Linux groups.

When you installed PostgreSQL it created a Linux user.   This is a non-root user that
"owns" all of the data and files in the database.  This Linux user, called postgres, is assocaited
with the 'postgres' role in the database.
 
Normally you can't just login to the 'postgres' user.  You have to access it via the `root` account.

```
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```

Now you can access the database using `psql` 

```
$ psql
newuser=> 
```

You can now use the database.  Note that you are in a special privilaed account in the database
and you can break things from this account.
 
To exit out of the PostgreSQL prompt, type:

```
newuser=> \q
```

 
This will bring you back to the Linux shell prompt.
To get back to your login account you can send the shell and end of file (EOF) by entering a Contro-D
or

```
$ exit 0
```
 
### Step 3 — Creating a New Role 

When you are logged in as the postgres Linux account, you can create a new role by typing:

```
$ createuser --interactive
```

This runs a number of commands in the database to create a user.  It is best to match the
username to your login Linux user.

A run of this for my user, `pschlump` looks like:

``` 
Enter name of role to add: pschlump
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
```

At this point you should be able to use `psql` to access the database from your user.



### Step 4 — Creating Additional Databases

In the PostgreSQL and MySQL/MaraiaDB workd a 'database' is storage and a set of tables
that works together.  In the Oracle world the 'database' is an installed system.
For us a 'database' is what we connect to so that we can see our tables.

In the interactive system each of you is using a 'database' in a single instance
of PostgreSQL.

When PostgreSQL created a user with `createuser` it created a database with the
same name that is owned by that login user.   For a user to login it has to have
some database to connect to.

This implies that when I create a PostgreSQL user `pschlump` it will have a `pschlump`
database.  A user can connect to other databases that it owns.  

From the postgres Linux account:

```
createdb studentdb
```

Will create a database.

Usually by this point I want to create a database without access to the `postgres`
Linux login.  This means that I do it via `psql`.

(Replace newuser with your Linux login name.  Replace mypass appropriately)

```
postgres $ psql
postgres=# create database newuser;
postgres=# create user newuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
postgres=# grant all privileges on database newuser to newuser;
postgres=# \q
```

This creates a new database user and associates it with a new 
database.

You should be able to connect to this account from your user now.

```
newuser $ psql

```

If you want `psql` to connect to a different user from your 
account:

```
psql -d newuser
newuser=# \conninfo
newuser=# \q
```

The output should look like:
 
```
You are connected to database "newuser" as user "newuser" via socket in "/var/run/postgresql" at port "5432".
```

## Windows install

You can install PostgreSQL directly on Windows 10 if you are running an x86 based 64 bit
processor.  I recommend the following YouTube video on how to do this.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w32xHj2nMSc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w32xHj2nMSc)


Given the choice I will setup a virtual machine running Linux and install PostgreSQL in
the virtual environment.

## MacOS (OS X)

PostgreSQL runs and works nicely on Mac OS.  There is a package version of PostgreSQL
that you can install from a .dmg and it puts a cute little Icon up on the top of
the screen - that has start/stop for the database.   After I install it
I want to access it via the command line (Using iTerm 2.x).   I always have to 
go and find where it installed it so that I can add that to my path.

```
$ find /Applications -name psql
```

When it finds the database then in your .bashrc (old) or now .zshrc file add
that path to the PATH variable.

Login to the `postgres` login user using 

```
$ sudo -i -u postgres
$ createuser --interactive
```

Then follow the Linux instructions to create a user.  You many encounter difficulties
if your username has a blank in it.
